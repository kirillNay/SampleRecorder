## SampleRecorder - the application for Yandex Cup 2023

The goal of the contest was to develop a minimalist music creation application that provides wide functionality within a single screen. The app should allow users to:
- Select instruments and choose different samples via tap and long press.
- Control sound parameters such as volume and repetition speed using touch gestures (e.g., sliders or alternative controls).
- Visualize sound through a dynamic area that reflects changes in the audio sequence during playback.
- Manage layers by adding and adjusting multiple tracks, each based on different instruments or microphone input.
- Record and playback a complete track, combining instruments, loops, and recorded audio.

## The Result

Key techniques I used in my implementation:
- C++ processing of audio inputs
- Low latency audio mixing using native lib
- Jetpack Compose for UI
